  <h3>Background</h3>
  
  <p>
    Antithrombotics are blood thinning medications that are used to treat a range of cardiovascular diseases.
    Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one such disease, and is the most common disturbance of heart rhythm and a common
    cause of stroke. In individuals who have AF, antithrombotics are used to lower stroke risk. However, around a
    third of those with AF are not on the most effective type of antithrombotic or take no medication at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    New evidence is emerging that individuals already taking antithrombotic medication (whether for AF or for
    another disease) may have improved outcomes if they become infected with COVID-19. However, the evidence for
    a protective association between antithrombotics and COVID-19 remains inconclusive.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project will, therefore, explore three questions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. How many individuals in the UK with AF are not currently on antithrombotic medication?</li>
    <li>2. What factors (e.g. location, age) are associated with a lack of antithrombotic medication in individuals with AF?</li>
    <li>3. Do individuals with AF taking antithrombotic medication prior to COVID-19 infection have better outcomes (e.g. hospitalisation, mortality) than those that donâ€™t?</li>
  </ul>
