  <h3>Background</h3>
  
  <p>
    Antithrombotics are blood thinning medications that are used to treat a range of cardiovascular diseases.
    Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one such disease, and is the most common disturbance of heart rhythm and a common
    cause of stroke. In individuals who have AF, antithrombotics (AT) are used to lower stroke risk. However, around a third of those with AF are not on the most effective type of AT or take no medication at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    New evidence is emerging that individuals already taking AT medication (whether for AF or for
    another disease) may have improved outcomes if they become infected with COVID-19. However, the evidence for
    a protective association between AT and COVID-19 remains inconclusive.
  </p>
  <p>
    This study, therefore, set out to conduct the largest scale evaluation of AT use in individuals with AF to date in routinely updated, linked, population-scale electronic health record (EHR) data for 56 million people in England. Utilising this statistical power, this study investigated what factors are associated with pre-existing AT use and whether pre-existing AT use (across sub-types) may reduce COVID-19 related hospitalisation and death.
